ðŸŽƒ I made a Halloween movie picker ðŸ‘»
https://halloween-movie-picker.vercel.app/

This is my first attempt at coding a website. I started learning how to code earlier this year, went all in over the summer, and now I am enrolled in school to become a software engineer. I built this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” with help from books, YouTube, Stack Overflow, AI, and lots of trial and error.

Itâ€™s not world-changing, but it helped me stay focused and turn something I love into something I made. Halloween is my favorite season, and this project made learning to code way more fun.

Thanks for checking it out and thanks for reading. Happy Halloween and happy coding ðŸ§¡
