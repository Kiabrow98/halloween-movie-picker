Hi, my name is Kia and welcome to my Halloween Movie Picker! ðŸŽƒ
Halloween has always been my favorite time of year, and combining my love for coding with my love for Halloween inspired me to create this project. 
Iâ€™m currently a software engineering student, and this is my very first project in web development. 
While it may not solve any real-world problems, it was a fun way for me to learn the basics and bring a little spooky fun to life.

Over time, I plan to keep adding more movies and new features to make the site even better. 
I hope you enjoy exploring it, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me by email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
 Thanks for checking out my project and enjoy the spooky season! ðŸ‘»
